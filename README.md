# Learning Elm

Why does this exist?
It's mostly notes for myself.
I hop around computers so this is just making my notes portable.

Why not just put it in your vimwiki?
Because I want the notes next to the code where I can observe syntax and put ideas to the written words.
Plus the vimwiki has more high-level notes.
This is more low-level and repetition notes.
